== Starting a workspace by entering a URL

As a user, you can create a workspace containing a clone of a Git repository by entering:

* a custom URL in the address bar of your browser.
* the URL of the Git repository on the {prod} dashboard page.

=== Short URL syntax for cloning hosted Git repositories

Short syntax is available when using {devworkspace} Operator.

To start a workspace with a clone of a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository, go to your browser's address bar and enter the {prod-short} URL, prepended with a `#` character and appended with the repository link. Using the example of Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat: link:https://workspaces.openshift.com#https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server[]. Then {prod} starts a workspace and clones the repository, `\https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server` in this example.


{prod} also searches for a `.devfile.yaml` or `devfile.yaml` file in the given repository. The devfile describes the containers and commands to use for that project. Omitting this file will result in a default container, which provides different languages (including Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Golang, etc) and tools (including `curl`, `jq`, `yq`, etc).

For more information about devfiles, see the link:https://devfile.io/[Devfile Documentation].

=== URL syntax by Git provider

URL syntax for cloning GitHub-hosted repositories to the starting workspace:

* To clone the default branch on GitHub to the starting workspace:
+
`#https://github.com/_<user_or_org>_/_<repository>_`
+
.Cloning the default branch of the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry[Plug-in registry repository].
====
`#https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry`
====

* To clone a specified branch on GitHub to the starting workspace:
+
`#https://github.com/_<user_or_org>_/_<repository>_/tree/_<branch-name>_`
+
.Cloning the `7.39.x` branch of the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry[Plug-in registry repository].
====
`#https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/tree/7.39.x`
====

* To clone the branch of a pull request on GitHub to the starting workspace:
+
`#https://github.com/_<user_or_org>_/_<repository>_/pull/_<pull-request-id>_`
+
.Cloning the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/pull/1097[Plug-in registry repository pull request `#1097`].
====
`#https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/pull/1097`
====

URL syntax for cloning GitLab-hosted repositories:

* To clone the default branch on GitLab to the starting workspace:
+
`#https://gitlab.com/_<user_or_org>_/_<repository>_`

* To clone a specified branch on GitLab to the starting workspace:
+
`#https://gitlab.com/_<user_or_org>_/_<repository>_/-/tree/_<branch>_`

URL syntax for cloning BitBucket-hosted repositories:

WARNING: {prod} supports only on premises BitBucket instances.


=== Using a different editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

{prod} starts workspaces with a default IDE: {prod-short} Theia.

Overriding the default editor is possible with the `?che-editor=__<editor-id>__` parameter. The `editor-id` comes from the identifier of the IDE in the plug-in registry.

.Using the next version of Theia (build after each commit) 
====
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/example/foo?che-editor=eclipse/che-theia/next]`
====

Some available IDE keys:

* `eclipse/che-theia/latest`
* `eclipse/che-theia/next`
* `che-incubator/intellij-community/latest`
* `che-incubator/pycharm/latest` 
* `che-incubator/che-code/insiders`

Obtain IDE keys from the plug-in registry by looking at `Che Editor` type entries.
====
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/che-plugin-registry/main/index.json]`
====

The parameter `?che-editor` accepts a link to the devfile hosted on a public server (with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled).

====
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/example/foo?che-editor=https://eclipse-che.github.io/che-plugin-registry/main/v3/plugins/che-incubator/che-code/insiders/devfile.yaml]`
====

=== Using a different devfile file from the repository

If the devfile file name is different from the default search pattern, which is `.devfile.yaml` or `devfile.yaml`, it is possible to override that name.

Use the parameter `?devfilePath=mydevfile.yaml` at the end of `{prod-url}#__<git_repository_url>__`.

====
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/example/foo?devfilePath=mydevfile.yaml]`
====

The short name for the `devfilePath` parameter is `df`.

====
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/example/foo?df=mydevfile.yaml]`
====


=== Creating or reusing a workspace


If you enter a URL such as `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#http://github.com/foo/bar]` and you donâ€™t have any workspace named `bar`, {prod} creates a workspace named `bar` and clones the GitHub repository.

Each time you enter a URL such as `{prod-url}#http://github.com/foo/bar` again, {prod} reopens the existing workspace `bar`.

=== Always creating a new workspace

To create another workspace each time you enter the same URL, enter the URL appended with `?new` in the URL format `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#http://github.com/foo/bar?new]`. Even if you already have a workspace named `bar`, each time you enter such URL, {prod} will create another, sequentially named workspace (example: `bar-abcde`).
